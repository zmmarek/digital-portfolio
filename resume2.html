          <h3>Python Code Portfolio </h3>
          <p> This Portfolio showcases various projects I've coded using Python. The first project is a digital version
            of Blackjack, developed for a mid-semester hackathon in my Python class. The second project uses the Turtle
            graphics library to draw a rough rendition of the Mona Lisa, created for the end-of-year hackathon in the
            same class. The third project focuses on encryption techniques and was developed for my Information Security
            class. </p>

          <h3>UWM Vetrans App Demo</h3>
          <p>This app, created using Figma, was developed as part of a final group project for the Human Factors in
            Information Seeking and Use course. The aim of the app was to provide veterans and active military students
            with a platform to access all available campus resources tailored to their needs. My primary contribution to
            the app was the 'Social' tab, allowing students to utilize a calendar feature to view upcoming campus
            events. </p>

          <h3>Personal and Profesonal Website</h3>
          <p>This website was developed using WordPress as part of my Web Design 1 class. Throughout the course, we
            explored various styles and techniques aimed at enhancing website aesthetics and accessibility for a wider
            audience. The site consists of three primary pages: the homepage, a personal page highlighting my interests
            and hobbies, and a professional page featuring links to my resume, portfolio, and LinkedIn profile.</p>

          <h3>Online Portfolio/Resume</h3>
          <p>I created this website during my LinkedIn Learning course titled "CSS Essential Training",. Through this
            course, I gained valuable insights into enhancing the appeal and responsiveness of my websites. using
            techniques such as flexbox, I learned to seamlessly adapt layouts to various screen sizes. This course
            strengthened my skills in web design, which I had already learned from previous courses like Web Design I.
